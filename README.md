# Labcoat
Enhance HTML with scholarly bibliographic and annotation features.

## Use it anywhere.
Labcoat is a *fast,* idempotent, side-effect-free, pure function with no dependencies. Its output is valid HTML5. You can use it:

1. in Node.js: `res.end(labcoat(html))`
1. in the browser: `document.body.innerHTML = labcoat(document.body.innerHTML)`
1. on the command line: `labcoat file.html` (Coming soon.)

## Prefatory comment on performance
Labcoat doesn't parse HTML, find, and then manipulate elements. It transforms one markup string into another, ignoring all but a narrowly specified set of labcoat elements (of which, more in due course). The remaining material is a subregular cousin of HTML, parsing of which is virtually instant.

**Benchmark:** Given a 5kb document making heavy use of labcoat features, with both latin and roman numbering, and basic citation style, transpilation takes about 900Î¼s (<1ms) on a 2.2ghz Core i7.

## Install it.
`npm install labcoat`

## Start with &lt;main>
Labcoat takes the standard HTML5 `<main>` element as its domain. That is, only material within an `<main>` will be transpiled from labcoat markup to HTML. In the unlikely event that transpilation fails, examine the helpful comment(s) left by the transpiler in the output HTML, just before the closing `</main>` tag.

## &lt;endnote> and &lt;endnotes />
Use the `<endnote>` element to get reciprocally-linked end notes. Use the companion self-closing `<endnotes />` element to indicate where you want the notes to appear in the transpiled HTML.

```html
<main>
  <p>Body text.<endnote>a note</endnote></p>
  <p>More body text.</p>
  ...
  <endnotes />
</main>
```
#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&darr;&darr;

```html
<main>
  <p>Body text.<sup><a id="intext-note-1" href="#endnote-1">1</a></sup></p>
  <p>More body text.</p>
  ...
  <section id="endnotes">
    <ol class="endnotes-list">
      <li id="endnote-1"><a href="#intext-note-1">a note</a></li>
    </ol>
  </section>
</main>
```

#### Numbering style
Default numbering style is plain integers; provide either a `latin` or `roman` attribute, as follows: `<endnotes latin />`. Then, set the `list-style` CSS property on `ol.endnotes-list` to match.

## &lt;citation /> and &lt;bibliography />
The `<citation>` element and the companion `<bibliography>` element allow the creation of linked in-text citations and a full-length, alphabetized bibliography section, using an store of bibliographic data.

```html
<main>
  <p>Body text (<citation chomsky93 />).</p>
  <bibliography>
    [
      {
        "id":         'chomsky93',
        "firstname":  'Noam',
        "lastname":   'Chomsky',
        "year":       1993,
        "title":      'The Minimalist Program',
        "publisher":  'MIT Press'
      }
    ]
  </bibliography>
</main>
```

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&darr;&darr;

```html
<main>
  <p>Body text (<cite><a href="#chomsky93">Chomsky 1993</a></cite>).</p>
  <section id="bibliography">
    <ol class="bibliography-list">
      <li id="chomsky93">
        Chomsky, Noam. (1993). The Minimalist Program. MIT Press.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>
</main>
```

### Citation style
Labcoat provides a basic APA-like citation style ("Surname YYYY" in-text citations and an alphabetical bibliography), which is surely adequate for most lay writing. Basic style will make use of the following fields, if provided:

1. **id** [required, string] must match the in-text citation id.
1. **firstname** [string] is the author's first name, if there is a single author.
1. **lastname** [string] is the author's surname, if there is a single author.
1. **year** [string|number]
1. **title** [string] is a book, article, or artwork title.
1. **publisher** [string] is the print or electronic/web publisher.
1. **authors** [string] is for multiple authors ("Chomsky & Halle").
1. **url** [string]
1. **accessed** [string] is the date a source was accessed.
1. **periodical** [string] is a journal or magazine name.
1. **conference** [string] is the name of a conference (to cite proceedings).
1. **volume** [string|number]
1. **number** [string|number]
1. **page** [string|number] is either a single page or a range of pages.

#### Creating a custom citation style
Labcoat's style API allows for easy use of custom styles. A style is simply an object with three* methods for transforming bibliographic data into HTML5 citations. These three methods are:

1. ***.inText( src )*** accepts an Object parameter and returns markup, to appear in-text.
1. ***.full( src )*** accepts an Object parameter and returns `<li>` markup, to appear in the bibliography.
1. ***.order( srcA, srcB )*** an [Array.sort callback](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) accepting two parameters of type Object and returning a Number.

Consult [basic style](/src/citation-renderers/basic) for example code.

\*If a style does not define `.inText()` or `.full()`, the basic style method will be used in its place. If the `.order()` method is not defined, order defaults to the order of appearance in the body text (as in MLA style writing).

#### Registering a citation style
You can register as many custom styles as you like, and you may overwrite/update previously registered styles (even the provided basic style). Register as follows:
```js
// Anywhere in your app.
import myStyle from './my-style'

labcoat.style('style-name', myStyle)
```

The two parameters are:

1. ***name*** [required, string] is non-empty, and contains only *a&ndash;z, 0&ndash;9,* hyphen, and underscore.
1. ***style*** [required, object] has 3 methods, described in the [previous section](#creating-a-custom-citation-style).

#### Using a citation style
First, labcoat's basic citation style is an implicit default&mdash;it does not need to be declared in the markup. To use a custom style after you've registered it (see the [previous section](#registering-a-citation-style)), invoke its name in your markup, as follows:

```html
<bibliography style-name>
```

## &lt;diagram> + &lt;diagcaption> and &lt;diag />
Labcoat uses `<diagram>` and `<diagcaption>` elements to create organized `<figure>` and `<figcaption>` elements; these will be automatically labeled, numbered, and ID'ed. Use the self-closing `<diag />` element to create in-text references to your diagrams, as shown here:

```html
<main>
  <diagram taj-mahal>
    <img src="taj-mahal.jpg">
    <diagcaption>the caption</diagcaption>
  </diagram>
  <p>And here we see <diag taj-mahal />.</p>
</main>
```

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&darr;&darr;

```html
<main>
  <figure class="diagram" id="figure-1" title="taj-mahal">
    <img src="taj-mahal.jpg">
    <figcaption>
      <span class="figure-label">Figure 1</span> the caption
    </figcpation>
  </figure>
  <p>And here we see <a class="figure-reference" href="#figure-1">Figure 1<a>.</p>
</main>
```

#### Numbering style options
The default numbering style is plain integers. You may specify otherwise by providing either a `latin-diagrams` or `roman-diagrams` attribute to the enclosing `<main>` element, as follows: `<main latin-diagrams>`.

## Future Additions
### &lt;example> and &lt;ex />
Use the `<example>` element to get automatically-numbered example cases, and use the companion self-closing `<ex />` element with an attribute (see below) to get in-text numeric references to your examples.

```html
<main>
  <example ecp-violation>
    John is illegal to park here.
  </example>
  <p>Here we have example (<ex ecp-violation />).</p>
</main>
```

#### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&darr;&darr;

```html
<main>
  <div class="example" id="ecp-violation">
    <span class="example-number">1</span> John is illegal to park here.
  </div>
  <p>Here we have example (<a href="#ecp-violation">1</a>).</p>
</main>
```
#### Numbering style options
The default numbering style is plain integers. You may specify otherwise by providing either a `latin-examples` or `roman-examples` attribute on the enclosing main element, as follows: `<main latin-examples>`.

### &lt;index />
An `<index />` element would place-hold for a simple linked index section at the top of the `<main>` element. An earlier attempt at this reveals that it is hard to do without general HTML parsing. A non-linked version would be easy, but a linked version requires tangling with `<section>` as well as `<h1>` to `<h6>`.

A conservative solution would be to remove attribute values (`="..."`) before parsing elements, to eliminate the possibility of in-attribute-value less-than and greater-than brackets causing the parse to fail. But how then do we replace the old markup with new, without erasing the attributes? Move them to a hash table, and add them later? This becomes complex. And non-instant.
