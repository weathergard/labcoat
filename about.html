      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        At <a href="https://weathergard.com">WeatherGard</a>, we work in home improvement. There is no industry so
        overrun with liars and cheats as ours. That&#8217;s why we care about citing
        sources&mdash;we want to get things right, 100% on the up-and-up, right
        down to the littlest detail. We want to clearly explain what we do with
        charts, photos, technical prose&mdash;whatever it takes to put it all out
        there.
      </p>

      <p>
        When it comes to citations, notes, and references, HTML offers zero
        help. The web is a cesspool of theft and omitted attribution at least
        in part because html makes doing the right thing such a pain. Nothing
        exists to ease that pain, so we created labcoat.
